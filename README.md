## The Elements of Programming:

### Expressions

    (+ 2.7 10)

Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application, are called combinations.

### Naming and the environment

### Evaluating combinations

**To evaluate a combination, do the following**

1. Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
2. Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands).

### Compound Procedures

### The Substitution Model for Procedure Application

### Conditional Expressions and Predicates

### Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method

### Procedures as Black Box Abstractions
